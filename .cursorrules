# Cursor/Claude Rules

## CRITICAL: Read CLAUDE.md First
Before starting ANY task, read CLAUDE.md for complete project guidelines.

## Top Priority Rules

### 1. MCP Tool First Approach
- **ALWAYS** use MCP tools (find_tool/call_tool) for external data before web_search
- For GitHub data (PRs, issues, commits): MUST use MCP GitHub tools
- For external APIs and services: Check for MCP tools first
- Only fall back to web_search if no MCP tool exists

### 2. Quality Gates (Mandatory)
After EVERY code edit, run ALL checks in sequence:
```bash
task format      # Fix formatting
task lint        # Check code quality
task typecheck   # Validate types
task test        # Run all tests
```

### 3. Package Management
- ALWAYS use `uv run <command>` (NEVER bare `python` or `pytest`)
- ALWAYS use `uv add <package>` (NEVER use `pip`)

### 4. Data Validation
- ALL structured data MUST use Pydantic models
- Use native Python types: `list`, `dict`, `str | None`

### 5. Testing First
- Write tests FIRST (TDD approach)
- Tests should FAIL initially
- Focus on integration and contract tests over unit tests
